**Github Code Management**

1. **Create a new branch named by developer from development-environment branch.**
2. **Before development, pull latest code from the env-dev branch.**
3. **After finishing your development and testing, push your code back to the branch named by yourself.**
4. **Send a pull request to dev-env and add your advisor as reviewer.**
