      <p>
        It is ScriptChain's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
        Policy applies to
        <a href="https://www.scriptchain.co" target="blank"
          >https://www.scriptchain.co</a
        >
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.scriptchain.co"). We respect
        your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
        information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this
        privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be
        collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
        circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
        Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the
        Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
        sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
        our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
        of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
        you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <h2><b>Website Visitors</b></h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, ScriptChain collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. ScriptChain's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how ScriptChain's visitors use its
        website. From time to time, ScriptChain may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        ScriptChain also collects potentially personally-identifying information
        like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
        leaving comments on https://www.scriptchain.co blog posts. ScriptChain
        only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.
      </p>

      <h2><b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b></h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to ScriptChain's websites choose to interact with
        ScriptChain in ways that require ScriptChain to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
        that ScriptChain gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
        example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://www.scriptchain.co to provide a username and email address.
      </p>

      <h2><b>Security</b></h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2><b>Advertisements</b></h2>
      <p>
        Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
        recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
        to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
        information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
        advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
        Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ScriptChain and does not
        cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
      </p>

      <h2><b>Links To External Sites</b></h2>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by
        us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
        third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
        services.

      <h2><b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</b></h2>
      <p>
        ScriptChain discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
        information in order to process it on ScriptChain's behalf or to provide
        services available at ScriptChain's website, and (ii) that have agreed
        not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
        using ScriptChain's website, you consent to the transfer of such
        information to them. ScriptChain will not rent or sell potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
        Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
        as described above, ScriptChain discloses potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
        response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
        when ScriptChain believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
        necessary to protect the property or rights of ScriptChain, third
        parties or the public at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a registered user of https://www.scriptchain.co and have
        supplied your email address, ScriptChain may occasionally send you an
        email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
        keep you up to date with what's going on with ScriptChain and our
        products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
        information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If
        you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
        feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
        help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
        users. ScriptChain takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
        against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information.
      </p>
