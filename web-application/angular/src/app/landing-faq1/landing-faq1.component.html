        <h5>What is Scriptchain?</h5>
        <p>
          ScriptChain is an AI based platform that helps physicians with
          identifying high risk patients of readmission and cardiovascular
          disease with actionable insights. We are a plugin to the major EMR
          systems that helps physicians save time and generate more revenue for
          their facility.

        <!-- <h5>Who are the users?</h5>
        <p>Our main users are primary care physicians and cardiologists.</p>
        <hr />
        <h5>Is this service free?</h5>
        <p>
          We have a software as a service model so we charge customers based on
          their usage bracket but are looking for beta volunteers to try out the
          platform for free for the first 50 patients!
        </p>

        <h5>When are we going to launch?</h5>
        <p>We are looking to launch officially nationwide early 2022.</p>
        <hr />
        <h5>Why is our domain tailored towards cardiovascular diseases?</h5>
        <p>
          Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of death not just in the United
          States but in the entire world accumulating to around 18 million
          deaths in 2017 alone and the figures are growing annually. Since we
          are in preventive medicine we believe we can make a significant
          difference in people's lives by intervening in the disease before
          patients are diagnosed and looking to lower the readmission rate in
          the nation that costs the healthcare system around $500M a week.
